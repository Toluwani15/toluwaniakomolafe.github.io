      <h3>Slime Game Playtesting Report <h3>
      <p>
        Conducted and analyzed a comprehensive user research study of Slime Game as part of a semester-long project. Designed and ran 15 structured playtesting sessions, collecting both observational and interview data to evaluate player behavior, frustration points, and satisfaction. Applied mixed-methods analysis, combining descriptive statistics with qualitative coding, to identify patterns in difficulty curves, confusing mechanics, and player engagement. Produced a 15-page professional report for the game’s developer that presented findings and actionable recommendations to improve onboarding, balance, and overall user experience.
