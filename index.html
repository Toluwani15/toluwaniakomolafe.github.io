      <h3>Slime Game Playtesting Report</h3>
      <p>
        Conducted and analyzed a comprehensive user research study of Slime Game as part of a semester-long project. Designed and ran 15 structured playtesting sessions, collecting both observational and interview data to evaluate player behavior, frustration points, and satisfaction. Applied mixed-methods analysis, combining descriptive statistics with qualitative coding, to identify patterns in difficulty curves, confusing mechanics, and player engagement. Produced a 15-page professional report for the game’s developer that presented findings and actionable recommendations to improve onboarding, balance, and overall user experience.

      <h3>Game Night</h3>
      <p>
        Game Night is a project created to tackle the key problem of decision paralysis - when groups struggle to choose which games to play. Thus, my solution was to transform a bunch of game suggestions into an interactive digital experience, making it engaging while still being efficient
        The target users are people who organize or participate in game nights with friends and family.

      <h3>Nightmare of Miracles</h3>
      <p>
       Developed a demo game emphasizing collaboration between technical and artistic roles. Worked in a team to design gameplay mechanics, integrate assets, and balance technical implementation. Used industry tools to build and refine the game through testing. <br> 
      Video Description:
      Nightmares of Miracles, an RPG presented in charming pixel art and a top-down style, begins with a tranquil and cutesy atmosphere, featuring engaging dialogues that introduce the player to Mistwood, the protagonist's new town. Taking on the role of an office worker at G-Neric Corp, the main character befriends their co-workers, including the seemingly innocuous Veronica, who will later be unveiled as the unsuspected antagonist. Initially disguised as the protagonist's best friend, Veronica's true villainous nature emerges gradually as the days unfold, with subtle disturbances and distorted rooms, visible only to the player. Strange encounters with Veronica heighten the main character's suspicions, leading to a gripping narrative where the protagonist must gather evidence to expose Veronica's connection to the town's unsettling transformations. The climax unfolds as the player confronts Veronica, engaging in a thrilling boss battle to thwart her evil plans and save Mistwood from impending doom.
